This repo contains a simplified overview of design pattern

## Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a
manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity
to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

### Singleton Pattern

The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is
useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
